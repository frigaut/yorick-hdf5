DescDetail: <<
HDF5 is the yorick interface plugin to the NCSA Hierarchical Data Format
version 5. It includes function for reading, writing, updating, getting
information on HDF5 files.

man page:
   DATA I/O:
     h5read(fname,target)                     return data
     h5write,fname,fullpath,data,zip=         write data
     h5open(filename,mode)                    return file handle
     h5close(filename)                        close file

   INFO, GROUP LINKING:
     h5info,fname,target,att=                 print out file info/structure
     h5link(fname,group,group2link2,linktype) link datasets
     h5delete,fname,object                    delete data

   ATTRIBUTE I/O:
     h5awrite(fname,object,aname,attdata)     write an object attribute
     h5aread(fname,object,aname)              read an object attribute
     h5adelete,fname,object,aname             delete an object attribute

   MISC:
     h5list_open                              list open files
     h5version                                return linhdf5 version
     
   ERROR RECOVERY
     h5off                              close all reference to the h5 library.
     
     + Many of the atomic HDF5 functions are available (e.g. H5Fopen, H5Dopen)
     with mostly the same APIs. Many simple tasks can be done with the
     provided high level wrappers. Beware that programming an HDF5 custom
     wrapper is not trivial. Make sure you close every objects opened!

     This implementation supports reading of most of the HDF5 supported
     datatype. Only yorick datatype can be used for writes. Compression, soft
     and hard links, as well as support for attribute read/writes is provided.

     There is no support for hyperslabs, compound, enum or opaque datatype.
     Generally, there is very little support for datatype related
     functionalities.

DescUsage: <<
See packages/tarballs/hdf5/check.i for a test suite. Type 
"yorick -batch check.i" in a terminal to run it.
<<
DescPort: <<
This package will compile Yorick only on MacOSX 10.3.4 or later, because
of a bug in the system math library libm (part of /usr/lib/LibSystem.dylib)
in earlier versions of MacOSX 10.3.
